    <div class="about" >
        My name is Tristan Larkin. Most of the time I am an over-caffeinated graduate student. 
        Otherwise, I am hiking, camping, rock climbing, and ping ponging. The <strong>T lambda</strong> that 
        appears around my site is a play on my initials TL, replacing the L with my favorite greek letter lambda 
        (yeah I have a favorite greek letter).

        I am a computer science and physics graduate, and am 
        continuing my education in physics at the University of New Mexico. I love learning about 
        the clever ways clever people have discovered to understand our crazy universe. I get particular satisfaction from 
        quantum mechanics and using symmetries to reorient a difficult problem into something easy. Given by background 
        it was inevitable for me to develop an interest in quantum computing, which has recently become my main focus. I 
        want to study the way quantum information acts and make strong analogies to category theory and type theory. I have a 
        hunch that there are valuable insights to be found in these fields and there are swaths of research already done that 
        might be able to be recycled into quantum information!

        I believe that programming a beautiful method we have to express our ideas, which happens to 
        be how we communicate with computers. In the same way that learning other <i>human</i> languages
        can extend your understanding of people, I am a proponent of learning many 
        programming languages, techniques, and paradigms to expand the breath of ways to think about a problem. 
        I had the opportunity to get into the weeds of Python while working on the 
        <a style="color:blue" href="https://opencsp.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">OpenCSP</a> 
        project at Sandia National Laboratories, but my favorite take on programming is displayed by  
        <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">Haskell</a>, 
        which is a functional programming language that is "non-standard" in such a beautiful way. 
        I also have dabbled with Julia, Pie, Scheme, C, Java, JS, and Go to varying degrees, and each of them 
        provides a lens in which to view the problems you want to solve.
