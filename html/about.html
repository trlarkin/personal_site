    <div class="about" >
        My name is Tristan Larkin. Most of the time I am an over-caffeinated graduate student. 
        Otherwise, I am hiking, camping, rock climbing, and ping ponging.

        I am a computer science and physics graduate, and am 
        continuing my education in physics at the University of New Mexico. I love learning about 
        the clever ways clever people have discovered to understand our crazy universe. I get particular satisfaction from 
        declarative/functional programming and symmetry. After this many programming and quantum mechanics classes I think 
        it was inevitable that I would end up finding quantum computing completely fascinating! I love to teach and never 
        fail to take advantage of an opportunity to introduce a new idea to a student or an interested friend.

        I believe that programming is a beautiful way that we can express ourselves, which happens to also 
        be the method we have to use to communicate with computers. I am a proponent of learning many 
        programming languages, techniques, and paradigms to best expand your breath of knowledge. 
        I had the opportunity to get into the weeds of Python while working on the 
        <a style="color:blue" href="https://opencsp.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">OpenCSP</a> 
        project at Sandia National Laboratories, but my favorite take on programming is displayed by  
        <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank">Haskell</a>, 
        which is a functional programming language that is "non-standard" in such a beautiful way. 
        I also have dabbled with Julia, Pie, Scheme, C, Java, JS, and Go to varying degrees, and each of them 
        provides a lens in which to view the problems you want to solve.
