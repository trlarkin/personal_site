<h1 class="title">Graduate School Process</h1>
</header>
<p>Over the past few months I have been going through the graduate
school application process. My journey started in September of 2023 and
now (March 2024) I believe the application process is coming to and end.
Here is a little documentation and hindsight I have after participating
in this process.</p>
<h2 id="the-start">The Start</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time around Physics professors and graduate
students, so grad school is mentioned a lot, especially in the late Jr
and early Snr years of college. Professors mention it, peers mention it,
TAs mention it. In the summer before my last year in college, I started
looking around. I have always wanted to attend University of California:
Santa Barbara (UCSB), and while I got in for undergraduate I chose to
attend the University of New Mexico (UNM) for financial and COVID
reasons, a decision I absolutely do not regret. I was working over the
summer, but felt like I had free time and wanted to start working on
grad applications, but none of the were open so I ended up just looking
at what schools I was interested in, taking into account their location
and general Physics prestige. I was originally thinking about applying
to PhDs in computer science in addition to PhDs in Physics, but ended up
running out of time (more on that later). In the USA (üèàü¶Öüå≠‚öæ) most PhD
programs are funded, and most masters programs are not, so I only
considered PhD programs.</p>
<h2 id="fellowships">Fellowships</h2>
<p>At the start of the school year a professor who I had gotten to know
fairly well was telling the seniors to apply to the NSF Graduate
Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), which is like a full ride for a few
years of graduate school. As I mentioned most schools fund your program,
but they expect their students to TA classes and changing topics can get
really tricky since your school gets to dictate a lot of what you do.
Having separate funding gives you more flexibility, and on top of that
its generally a little more than the school gives. The application for
the GFRP was a lot of the same things I needed for my grad school
applications, but while the schools had a deadline of December 15th, the
GFRP was due in mid October. This all sounded great: more freedom, more
money, and a deadline that would help me avoid procrastination (or so I
thought). In addition to the standard stuff, this application also
required me to write a short research proposal for a possible PhD
project.</p>
<p>Over the course of September and early October I spend a few hours
every week writing up everything and getting feedback from a whole bunch
of peers, friends, and professors. The night before the deadline I was
on a trip in Los Angeles, rapidly making final edits to my personal
statement is my hotel before an MUN conference the next day. Then I was
done‚Ä¶ but <strong>nope</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="uh-oh-.-__-.">Uh Oh <code>(. __ .)</code></h2>
<p>The thought of being ‚Äòdone‚Äô with something and feeling like I had
earned a break ended up hurting my from the application standpoint. I
had some time before application needed my full attention, but school
was just picking up. I had two Computer Science classes and three
Physics classes that I had been somewhat half-assing in favor of doing
the GFRP application and relaxing. On top of being behind, I felt like I
deserved a break, but I didn‚Äôt get one. Instead I had to fight the
feeling of underperforming at work and in classes while keeping it all
together. As a result, I ended up falling further behind is classes that
I really would have liked under other circumstances and made zero
progress on school applications.</p>
<h2 id="finals-week">Finals Week</h2>
<p>Time flew by making almost no progress on graduate applications, and
the deadline rearing its head just around the corner. Thankfully finals
were coming, which is usually an easy week for me. I am generally a very
good student, <code>;)</code>, so finals are a quick review, going over
missed midterm problems, and showing up for the test. When I started
reviewing the material in every class I quickly realized how far behind
I was in almost every class. In addition to the four final exams I also
had a final group project in a computational science class. I thought
setting aside around 20 hours the weekend before the project was due
would be good enough. <em>WRONG</em>! Over the span of the weekend I
barely figured out <em>how</em> to do what I needed to do, let along
<strong>doing</strong> it. By Monday I was able to start what we needed
for the project. My ‚ÄúElectricity and Magnetism‚Äù final ended up being a
take home exam on Tuesday. I expected it to be a two to 3 hour tests,
and I even studied for it on Monday night to help take some pressure off
during the test. From when we were able to start the test to when it was
due 24 hours later, I spend 10 hours looking through Griffiths‚Äô EM book
and solving equations. I slept on the couch so I could get up faster and
continue when I needed to sleep.</p>
<p>I turned in the (almost) finished test around 9 AM on Wednesday, then
immediately went to study for the ‚ÄúQuantum Mechanics‚Äù final at 2 PM.
Then after that I went to basically learn half a semester of information
for my 7:45 PM ‚ÄúComputer Architecture‚Äù final. The group project was due
that night, but when I laid down for a quick rest and a YouTube video, I
fell asleep. Thursday morning I woke up at 5 AM, and freaked out. I
immediately grabbed my computer and got to coding. My partner was asking
me about the section I was in charge of and I let him know I was having
trouble. He had some of his finals sprinkled in that day, but I was just
doing that project. 5 AM turned to sunrise, to 8 AM, to noon, to 6 PM,
and it wasn‚Äôt working. The project had been due the night before, and it
was a mess of code that didn‚Äôt work. I took a break and got some pizza
with my girlfriend (which was possibly the only thing that kept my brain
from literally exploding that day) then went back to it. 24 hours late,
we turned in a jumbled mess of code, with a report that identified more
things about our results that were wrong than expected. I was
disappointed, but I called my mom and she convinced me to sleep for my
last final on Friday morning. The Friday morning final went well and
finals week was over. But‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="december-15th">December 15th</h2>
<p>That last Friday of finals was December 15th, aka <em>the final due
date for all my graduate school applications</em>! I could recount the
experience of going through all these applications and stitching
together pieces of different things I had written for the fellowship and
various writings I had, but I can sum it up as a mess. I was able to
find some very interesting researchers at the schools I had chosen to
look into, but didn‚Äôt have time to look into every school. I mostly
chose my initial list of schools based on location, prestige, and
opportunity. I had hoped to narrow them down to around six schools that
had professors with correlated interests as I do. In the end I only had
time to research five schools, and I applied to those. I don‚Äôt remember
if I went to bed after that, or if I went out with friends, but this
time I actually felt DONE.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-time">One more time‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>There were actually a couple more things to apply for. My
undergraduate university had a few extra days before their application
was due, and it was easier anyways. There was also another fellowship
due in mid January, but it is specifically a Computational Sciences
fellowship, and I have so much experience in that realm that it was much
easier and I had all winter break. Without school hanging over my head I
was able to do these and actually enjoy some of the introspection
applications give. I get to list out all my accomplishments and show off
my potential as a scientist. I wish my whole experience was like these,
and not the rushed mess of emotion and stress that was overwhelmingly my
experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-wait">The Wait</h2>
<p>December passed, then January, and nothing. As February went on I
watched one of my buddies in Biology travel the country to visit close
to a dozen schools for interviews and open houses for accepted students,
while I just waited. I got a valentines day present from my
undergraduate university, my first acceptance. This felt nice, but I had
basically already been told that I was going to get in so it isn‚Äôt quite
the win I need. I got my first and seconds rejections today and that
hurt a bit (prompting me to write this). One school offered ‚Äúapplication
feedback‚Äù which I requested. Part of me is worried about seeing what was
wrong, but I think it will help me in the future.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>Whatever happens I am confident in myself. I am hopeful I hear good
news soon, but even if I don‚Äôt get into more schools I have plenty of
good options. My biggest hope is just that I learn from my past, and
avoid the chaos that was my graduate application experience. I wish
everyone who is waiting on applications luck! <code>:)</code></p>
